## Installation

Clone the repository, `cd` into the directory and run `npm install` on your command line to install all the dependencies. You're ready to go now!

## Usage

There are npm scripts for all the relevant things. The server will always be started on port 8500 unless otherwise specified in process.env.PORT. You can use a .env file to specify env vars. If you want to use them in your client side code, don't forget to add them in config/env.js.

#### `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode: creates a new client and server dev build using webpack, starts the Express server build (for both file serving and server side pre-rendering) and keeps webpack open in watchmode. Updates the app (if possible) on change using HMR.

#### `npm run build`

Creates a new build optimized for production.

#### `npm run lint:js`

Run ESLint for all JavaScript and TypeScript files

#### `npm run lint:css`

Run Stylelint for all CSS files

#### `npm run lint:sass`

Run Stylelint for all SASS files

#### `npm run lint`

Run lint:js, lint:css and lint:sass in parallel

#### `npm run analyze`

Starts `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to give you the opportunity to analyze your bundle(s)

## Environment Variables

There are a few environment variables you can set to adjust the setup to your needs

| Variable         | Default            | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`           | `8500`             | Port number your application will be served                      |
| `HOST`           | `http://localhost` | Host (including protocol!) your application will be served on.   |
| `DEVSERVER_HOST` | `http://localhost` | Optional. Different host for the Webpack Dev Server to be served |

## Tricks

### Avoid source map generation for faster builds

In some cases you might not want to generate source maps for the generated files. In this case you can set the `OMIT_SOURCEMAP` environment variable to `true`. No source map files will be generated then. This works no matter if you're in devmode or building for production.

### Change the port of the dev environment

By default if you run `npm start` the development server will use port 8500. You can change this by specifying a `PORT` environment variable.
